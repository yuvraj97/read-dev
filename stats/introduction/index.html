<h1 id="goals">Goals <a href="#goals" aria-label="goals"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h1>
Goals of this chapter are: <br>
\(1.)\) To give an introduction to the <b>mathematical theory</b> behind <b>statistical models</b>.<br>
\(2.)\) Understand the <b>limitations</b> of the <b>statistical models</b>.<br>
\(3.)\) Talk about theoretical guarantees (Which method is better than the other)<br>
After this chapter, we will be able to formulate a real-life situation in mathematics by selecting an appropriate statistical model.<br>
<br>

<h1 id="why">Why statistics? <a href="#why" aria-label="why-statistics"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h1>

Now let's see where <i>statistics</i> is used in real-life.<br>
<b>For example</b>, see this <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"  href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/18/upshot/nike-vaporfly-shoe-strava.html">New York Times article</a>,
here it is claimed that,
<blockquote>
	"These $250 running shoes will make you run faster"</i>
</blockquote>
They claim to have <b>500,000</b> data points  of running time for different shoes.<br>
And what we are trying to understand here is that, Are <b>500,000</b> data points sufficient?
What if there are <b>5Million</b> or say <b>50Million</b>!<br>
<br>

<b style="font-size: larger;">Data</b> comes from a <b>random process</b>,
They <b>aren't</b> just a <i>sequence of numbers</i>,
and <span title="Here we are talking about our Data"><u>those</u></span>
 numbers are representative of that <b>random process</b>. <br>
The goal of statistics is to <span title="Extrapolation is the process of finding a value outside a data set. It could even be said that it helps predict the future!"><u>extrapolate</u></span> from a finite number of data to what we can get if we had an \(\infty\) amount of observation. If we have an \(\infty\) amount of data we can describe a random process (but there still be some randomness), and this process helps us to make a prediction.<br>
To understand randomness, we need <b><i>Probability</i></b>(it's also prerequisite for <b>Statistics</b>).<br>
<br>




<h1 id="probability">Probability <a href="#probability" aria-label="probability"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h1>
<span title="In probability"><u>Here</u></span>, we have a description of a <b>random process</b> and we are asked about the outcome from that random process, like <b>expectation, probability distribution, etc</b>.<br>
Now the <b>question</b> is where does <b>Statistics</b> fit in all of this<b>?</b>.<br>
We don't need statistics to understand that, <i>a fair die has \(\frac{1}{6}\) chance to outcome a 1</i>
OR <i>a fair coin has \(\frac{1}{2}\) chance to outcome a heads</i>.<br>
<blockquote>
<b>But</b> what if we don't know about that <b>random process</b>, then we need <b>statistics</b> to figure it out.
</blockquote>
What if the coin isn't fair?<br>
We flip a coin, collect the number of <b>Heads</b> and <b>Tails</b> and then we would try to see that probability is converging to maybe 1/2.
<br><br>
Sometimes there is <b>real</b> randomness like a biased coin, measurement error,  etc.<br>
Sometimes there is <b>no </b>randomness, this is where most of the randomness comes from,<br>
<blockquote class="noborder">
	<b>Example:</b> <br>
	Say we have \(4\) types of food "<b>Pizza</b>","<b>Pasta</b>", "<b>Hamburger</b>" and "<b>Rice</b>". <br>
	We want to predict a person's favorite food among these \(4\). <br>
	To achieve it we want some parameters like their <b>Age</b>, <b>Gender</b>, <b>Locality</b>, etc. <br>
	There are soo many parameters we can't even think about, so we <b>can't</b> tell their favorite food with \(100\%\) certainty. <br>
	So we pick parameters that we can collect and based on them we can give our prediction.
</blockquote>
So there is a huge component that we <b>don't understand</b>. <br>
When we talk about genes we are trying to predict personalized medicines based on gene profiles. Gene profile tells a lot about some disease but not everything. So there are things that we don't understand, it's just not accessible to us.<br>
<br>

<h1 id="modeling">Statistical Modeling <a href="#modeling" aria-label="statistical-modeling"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h1>
What will we do when we encounter a Complicated situation? <br>
We split the Complicated process into two parts, First is a <b>simple process</b> that we are able to understand, about the process, and the other one is <b>Random Noise</b> that we are not able to understand.<br>
<blockquote class="noborder">
	Say we want to travel from <b>Tokyo</b> to <b>India</b>, so what should we do?<br>
	We book our tickets, pack our bags, then head over to India.<br>
	That is what we know, but what we don't know is.<br>
	<ul>
		<li>What if seats are already full.</li>
		<li>What if our cab malfunctions.</li>
		<li>What if the flight gets delayed.</li>
	</ul>
	There is no certainty of these events happening, but there is a possibility.
	These events are what we are referring to, as <b>Random Noise</b>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<b>Complicated Process \(\equiv\) Simple Process + Random Noise</b>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Good Modeling consists of choosing (plausible) simple process and noise distribution.

<img id='dogma' class="full-size-img" src="/stats/img/dogma.png" alt="Central Dogma of Probability and Statistics">


<span title="The image showed just above"><u>This</u></span> is the Central <span title="a principle laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true."><u>Dogma</u></span> of probability and statistics, so it implies:
<blockquote>
We have a <b>truth</b>(Random Process) that generates <b>data</b> and <b>probability</b> will tell us what our data look like.
</blockquote>
For example:
Say that we have our fair coin as <b>truth</b>, <span title="or say, we don't know the underlying pattern by which this sequence of heads and tails is emerging"><u>we don't know how it generates the sequence of heads and tails</u></span>, all we see is a (random) sequence of heads and tails.<br>
If we don't know anything about the coin (like is it fair or not), <b>statistics</b> will be useful. Here we try to recover <b>truth</b> from <b>data</b>.<br>

<h1 id="kiss_ex">The Kiss Example <a href="#kiss_ex" aria-label="kiss-example"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h1>
Source: <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/421711a">https://www.nature.com/articles/421711a</a><br>
So the question here is, <i>"Do people have a preference of turning their head to the right when kissing?"</i><br>
According to the author, the study concludes:<br>

<blockquote>A neonatal right-side preference makes a surprising romantic reappearance later in life.</blockquote>
Data is very simple, a person goes out and records whether people turn their head to the left or right.<br>
So how can we tackle this problem?<br>
Now if a person collected data and (say) 90% of them turn their head to the right, then it's an indication that peoples do have a preference of turning their head to the right.<br>
But how to decide the <b>cutoff</b> (beyond which we can say 'Yes' people do have a preference of turning their head to the right)?<br>
What if the data states that 51% of them turn their head to the right, then can we say it is an indication that peoples do have a preference of turning their head to the right?<br>

What we want is to understand the true proportion of people turning there head to the right, in the entire population of the world.<br>
<br>

<h1 id="statistical-experiment">Statistical experiment <a href="#statistical-experiment" aria-label="statistical-experiment"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h1>
\(p\): Proportion of couples who turns their head to the right while kissing.<br>
\(n\): Total number of observation (say 1 for RIGHT and 0 for LEFT)<br>
\(\hat{p}\): estimator of \(p\).<br>
According to study \(n=124\) and \(80\) peoples turns their head to the right.<br>
\[\hat{p}=\frac{80}{124}=64.5\%\]<br>
64.5% seems to be \(\gt\)  50% but is it <b>significantly larger</b> then 50%?<br>
<br>
Say that we have <b>only 3 data points</b>.<br>
<ul>
	<li>Will you convince if we have 3 Right (\(\hat{p}=100\%\))?</li>
	<li>Will you convince if we have 2 Right(\(\hat{p}=66.66\%\))?</li>
</ul>

Intuitively, the question is \(n=3\) is too small \(n=124\) may be large enough, question is what is the right number for \(n\)?<br>
This question is important, <b>What your sample size should be?</b><br>

Another way to present this problem is, for \(n=124\) What is the minimum number of couples that move their head to the right would we need to convince ourselves that p\(\gt\)50%? or p\(\gt\)63% or p\(\gt\)72 or ...<br>
<br>

<h1 id="kiss_ex_est">Estimator <a href="#kiss_ex_est" aria-label="estimator"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h1>
<div class="math-container">
	\[R_i=\left\{\begin{matrix}
	1& \text{if }i^{th}\text{ turns to right}\\
	0& \text{if }i^{th}\text{ did not turns to right}
	\end{matrix}\right. ;\quad i=1,...,n\]
</div>
\[\hat{p}=\overline{R}_n=\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}R_i\]

\(\sum^n_{i=1}R_i\) is the number of \(1's\) so if I have \(80\ 1's\) in the sequence then \(\sum^n_{i=1}R_i=80\)<br>
\(\hat{p}\) is <b>Sample average \(\overline{R}_n\)</b><br>

Ok we got an estimator but what is it's <b>Accuracy</b>, how good is it, what does the accuracy even <b>mean? </b>
Accuracy of our estimator \(\hat{p}\) depends on <b>true</b> \(p\) which we don't even know.
We want to know how close is \(\hat{p}\)  to <b>true</b> \(p\) this is where <b>randomness</b> comes into play.
We think of \(R_i\) as random variables so that \(\hat{p}\) is also a random variable.
Now this random variable (\(\hat{p}\)) will tend to take some values \(\in [0,1]\).<br>
<br>

<h1 id="assumptions">Modeling assumptions <a href="#assumptions" aria-label="assumptions"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h1>
Coming up with a model that consists of making assumptions on what those \(R_i\)'s are. So here are the assumptions that we made:<br>
\(1.\quad\) Each \(R_i\) is a random variable.<br>
\(2.\quad\) Each \(R_i\) is a Bernoulli(we will see it later) with parameter \(p\)<br>
\(3.\quad\) \(R_1,R_2,...,R_n\) are mutually independent<br>
