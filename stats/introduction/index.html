\(2.)\) Understand the <b>limitations</b> of the <b>statistical models</b>.<br>
\(3.)\) Talk about theoretical guarantees (Which method is better than the other)<br>
After this chapter, we will be able to formulate a real-life situation in mathematics by selecting an appropriate statistical model.<br>

	<br>
Let's see an example where <i>statistics</i> is used in real-life.<br>
See this <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"  href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/18/upshot/nike-vaporfly-shoe-strava.html">New York Times article</a>,
here it is claimed that,
<blockquote class="sidebar">
	"These \(\$250\) running shoes will make you run faster"
</blockquote>
They claim to have <b>\(500,000\)</b> data points  of running time for different shoes.<br>
And what we are trying to understand here is that, Are <b>\(500,000\)</b> data points sufficient?
What if there are <b>5Million</b> or say <b>50Million</b> data points!<br>


<blockquote class="noborder">
<b style="font-size: larger;">Data</b> comes from a <b>random process</b>. <br>
They <b>aren't</b> just a <i>sequence of numbers</i>,
and <span title="Here we are talking about our Data"><u>those</u></span>
 numbers are representative of that <b>random process</b>. <br>
</blockquote>
The goal of statistics is to <span title="Extrapolation is the process of finding a value outside a data set. It could even be said that it helps predict the future!"><u>extrapolate</u></span> from a finite number of observations to what we can get if we had an \(\infty\) amount of observation. If we have an \(\infty\) amount of data we can describe a random process (but there still be some randomness), and this process helps us to make a prediction.<br>
To understand randomness, we need <b><i>Probability</i>.</b>.<br>
<br>




<h1 id="probability">Probability <a href="#probability" aria-label="probability"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h1>
<span title="In probability"><u>Here</u></span>, we have a description of a <b>random process</b> and we are asked about the outcome from that random process, like <b>expectation, probability distribution, etc</b>.<br>

Now the <b>question</b> is where does <b>Statistics</b> fit in all of this<b>?</b>.<br>
We don't need statistics to understand that, <i>a fair die has \(\frac{1}{6}\) chance to outcome a 1</i>
OR <i>a fair coin has \(\frac{1}{2}\) chance to outcome a heads</i>.<br>
<blockquote class="noborder">
<b>But</b> what if we don't know about that <b>random process</b>, then we need <b>statistics</b> to figure it out.
</blockquote>
What if the coin isn't fair?<br>
We flip a coin, collect the number of <b>Heads</b> and <b>Tails</b> and calculate proportion of <b>Heads</b>  and see that is probability converging 1/2.<br>
<br>
<!-- <h2>Randomness</h2> -->
Sometimes there is <b>real</b> randomness like a biased coin, measurement error,  etc.<br>
<b>For Example</b> <br>
&bull; Flipping a coin
<blockquote class="sidebar">
	When we flip a coin then every flip in itself is random, coins had no freewill to land either <b>Heads</b> or <b>Tails</b>
</blockquote>
&bull; Measurement Error
<blockquote class="sidebar">
	No instrument is perfect, every instrument have some error, and this error is completely random, an instrument doesn't decides how much error it should produce it's just random.
</blockquote><br>

Sometimes there is <b>no </b>randomness, this is where most of the randomness comes from,<br>
<b>For Example</b> <br>
<blockquote class="sidebar">
	Say we have \(4\) types of food "<b>Pizza</b>","<b>Pasta</b>", "<b>Hamburger</b>" and "<b>Rice</b>". <br>
	We want to predict a person's favorite food among these \(4\). <br>

	<blockquote class="noborder">
		A single person's preference is not random, for him/her self.
	</blockquote>
	<!-- <br> -->
	<!-- <blockquote class="noborder"> -->
	There is only one food which is your most favorite, and if I ask you about your favorite food 100 times, your answer will not change. <br>
	<i>But for a statistician each person's favorite food is random.</i> <br>
	<!-- </blockquote> -->
	<br class="newline">

	In order to predict a person's favorite food we want some parameters like their <b>Age</b>, <b>Gender</b>, <b>Locality</b>, etc. <br>
	There are soo many parameters we can't even think about, so we <b>can't</b> tell their favorite food with \(100\%\) certainty, there will be some randomness. <br>
	So we pick parameters that we can collect and based on them we can give our prediction.
	<blockquote class="noborder">
		So there is a huge component that we <b>do not understand</b>. <br>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote><br>


When we talk about genes we are try to predict personalized medicines based on gene profiles. Gene profile tells a lot about some disease but not everything. So there are things that we don't understand, it's just not accessible to us.<br>
<br>

<h1 id="statistical-modeling">Statistical Modeling <a href="#statistical-modeling" aria-label="statistical-modeling"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h1>
What will we do when we encounter a Complicated situation? <br>
We split the Complicated process into two parts, First is a <b>simple process</b> that we are able to understand, about the process, and the other one is <b>Random Noise</b> that we are not able to understand.<br>
<blockquote>
	<b>\(\text{Complicated Process} \equiv \text{Simple Process} + \underbrace{\text{Random Noise}}_{\text{Modelling assumption}}\)</b>
</blockquote>
<b>Example</b>
<blockquote class="sidebar">
	Say we want to travel from <b>Tokyo</b> to <b>India</b>, so what should we do?<br>
	We book our tickets, pack our bags, then head over to India.<br>
	That is what we know, but what we don't know is.<br>
	<ul>
		<li>What if seats are already full.</li>
		<li>What if our cab malfunctions.</li>
		<li>What if the flight gets delayed.</li>
	</ul>
	There is no certainty of these events happening, but there is a possibility.
	These events are what we are referring to, as <b>Random Noise</b>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Good Modeling consists of choosing (plausible) simple process and noise distribution(modelling assumption).

<img id='dogma' class="full-size-img" src="/stats/img/dogma.png" alt="Central Dogma of Probability and Statistics">


<span title="The image showed just above"><u>This</u></span> is the Central <span title="a principle laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true."><u>Dogma</u></span> of probability and statistics, it implies:
<blockquote>
We have a <b>truth</b>(Random Process) that generates <b>data</b> and <b>probability</b> will tell us what our data look like.
</blockquote>
For example:
Say that we have our fair coin \((p=0.5)\) as <b>truth</b>, <span title="or say, we don't know the underlying pattern by which this sequence of heads and tails is emerging"><u>we don't know how it generates the sequence of heads and tails</u></span>, all we see is a (random) sequence of heads and tails.<br>
If we don't know anything about the coin (like is it fair or not), then we use <b>statistics</b> to figure it out (with some level of confidence). <span title="In Statistics"><u>Here</u></span> we try to recover <b>truth</b> from the <b>data</b>.<br>
<br>

<h1 id="counting-balls-example">The Counting Balls Example<a href="#counting-balls-example" aria-label="counting-balls-example"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h1>
Say we have a <b>room</b> full of <span class="l1">Red balls</span> and <span class="l2">Blue balls</span>. <br>
We want to determine among <span class="l1">Red balls</span> and <span class="l2">Blue balls</span> which of them have higher proportion,
But we won't be able to count all the balls in the room as there are too many of them. <br>
So instead what we do is, we took a small sample of <b>balls</b> from that <b>room</b>, then find the proportion of <span class="l1">Red balls</span> and <span class="l2">Blue balls</span> in that <b>sample</b>
and hope that proportion we just estimated is somewhat near the <b>True proportion</b>(for the whole room). <br>
<br class="newline">
So how can we tackle this problem?<br>
Assume that our small sample have 90% of <span class="l1">Red balls</span>, then it's an indication that proportion of <span class="l1">Red balls</span> is higher than proportion of <span class="l2">Blue balls</span>.<br>
But how to decide the <b>cutoff</b> (beyond which we can say 'Yes' proportion of <span class="l1">Red balls</span> is higher than proportion of <span class="l2">Blue balls</span>)?<br>
What if the data states that in our sample 51% of the balls are <span class="l1">Red balls</span>, then can we say it is an indication that proportion of <span class="l1">Red balls</span> is higher than proportion of <span class="l2">Blue balls</span>?<br>

What we want is to understand the true proportion of proportion of <span class="l1">Red balls</span> and <span class="l2">Blue balls</span>, in the entire room.<br>
<br>

<h1 id="statistical-experiment">Statistical experiment <a href="#statistical-experiment" aria-label="statistical-experiment"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h1>
Let, <br>
\(p\): Proportion of <span class="l1">Red balls</span>.<br>
\(n\): Total number of balls in our sample. <br>
\(\hat{p}\): estimator of \(p\).<br>
Here we assign <span class="l1">\(1\)</span> for <span class="l1">Red balls</span> and <span class="l2">\(0\)</span> for <span class="l2">Blue balls</span><br>
<blockquote class="sidebar">
So if we denote \(i^{th}\) ball by \(B_i\) then, <br>
\(\sum_{i=1}^{n}B_i=\) Total number of <span class="l1">Red balls</span> in our sample. <br>
is \(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}B_i\) is the proportion of <span class="l1">Red balls</span> in our sample. <br>

</blockquote>

<!-- According to study \(n=124\) and \(80\) peoples turns their head to the right.<br> -->
Say we took a sample of \(n=300\) balls and in that sample \(180\) balls are <span class="l1">Red</span> so,
\[\hat{p}=\frac{180}{300}=60\%\]<br>
60% seems to be \(\gt\)  50% but is it <b>significantly larger</b> then 50%?<br>
<br class="newline">
Say that we have <b>only 3 data points</b>.
<ul>
	<li>Will you be convinced if we have 3 <span class="l1">Red balls</span> (\(\hat{p}=100\%\))?</li>
	<li>Will you be convinced if we have 2 <span class="l1">Red balls</span> (\(\hat{p}=66.66\%\))?</li>
</ul>

So the question here we are asking is, how large  should be our sample size \((n)\). <br>
\(n=3\) is too small \(n=300\) may be large enough, so what is the right number for \(n\)?<br>
This question is important, <b>What your sample size should be?</b><br>
<br class="newline">
We can also ask that, for \(n=300\) What is the minimum number of <span class="l1">Red balls</span> that we want to convince ourselves that proportion of <span class="l1">Red balls</span> is higher than proportion of <span class="l2">Blue balls</span><br>
<br>

<h1 id="counting-balls-estimator">Estimator <a href="#counting-balls-estimator" aria-label="counting-balls-estimator"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h1>
<div class="math-container">
	\[B_i=\left\{\begin{matrix}
	1& \text{if the }i^{th}\text{ ball is Red}\\
	0& \text{if the }i^{th}\text{ ball is Blue}
	\end{matrix}\right. ;\quad i=1,...,n\]
</div>
\[\hat{p}=\overline{B}_n=\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}B_i\]

<!-- \(\sum^n_{i=1}B_i\) is the number of \(1's\) so if I have \(80\ 1's\) in the sequence then \(\sum^n_{i=1}B_i=80\)<br> -->
\(\hat{p}\) is <b>Sample average</b> \(\overline{B}_n\) it's average over our sample.<br>

Ok we got an estimator but what is it's <b>Accuracy</b>? But what does the accuracy even <b>mean? </b>. <br>
Accuracy of our estimator \(\hat{p}\) depends on sample size \(n\), \(3\) balls aren't enough but \(300\) balls might be enough.
Accuracy of \(\hat{p}\) also depends on <b>true</b> \(p\) <b>which we don't even know</b>.
We want to know how close is \(\hat{p}\) to the <b>true</b> \(p\) (this is where <b>randomness</b> comes into play). <br>
We think of \(B_i\) as random variables so \(\hat{p}\) is also a random variable, \(\hat{p}\) will tend to take some values \(\in [0,1]\).<br>
<br>

<h1 id="modeling-assumptions">Modeling assumptions <a href="#modeling-assumptions" aria-label="modeling-assumptions"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h1>
Coming up with a model consists of making assumptions on what those \(B_i\)'s are. So here are the assumptions that we made:<br>
\(1.\quad\) Each \(B_i\) is a random variable.<br>
<blockquote class="sidebar">
	Each ball draw is random, the ball can be a <span class="l1">Red balls</span>(with probability \(p\)) or a <span class="l2">Blue balls</span>(with probability \(1-p\)). <br>
	So every \(B_i\) is either <span class="l1">1</span>(with probability \(p\)) or <span class="l2">0</span>(with probability \(1-p\)), so \(B_i\) is a random variable.<br>
</blockquote>
<br class="newline">
\(2.\quad\) Each \(B_i\) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution">Bernoulli</a> random variable with parameter \(p\)<br>
<blockquote class="sidebar">
	Every \(B_i\) is either <span class="l1">1</span>(with probability \(p\)) or <span class="l2">0</span>(with probability \(1-p\)).
	<div class="math-container">
		\[B_i=\left\{\begin{matrix}
		1& \text{if the }i^{th}\text{ ball is Red}\\
		0& \text{if the }i^{th}\text{ ball is Blue}
		\end{matrix}\right. ;\quad i=1,...,n\]
	</div>
	So \(B_i\) has no choice but to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution">Bernoulli</a> random variable. <br>
	\[B_i\sim\text{Ber}(p)\]

	But wait there's a hidden assumption, <br>
	&bull; \(p\) is same for every draw
	<blockquote class="sidebar">
		It means for every draw, probability of drawing a <span class="l1">Red ball</span> is \(p\) and
		probability of drawing a <span class="l2">Blue ball</span> is \(1-p\). <br>
		So every Random variable \(B_i\) is <b>Identically distributed</b>.
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<br class="newline">
\(3.\quad\) \(B_1,B_2,...,B_n\) are mutually independent<br>
<blockquote class="sidebar">
	Every draw is an independent draw. <br>
	If we draw a <span class="l1">Red balls</span> then it gives us no information about our next draw, proportion of drawing a <span class="l1">Red balls</span> is still \(p\). <br>
	So we can say that \(B_1,B_2,...,B_n\) are mutually independent<br>
